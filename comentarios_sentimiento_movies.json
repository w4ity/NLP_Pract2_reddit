Take the hook, slow it down and drown it in a heavy reverb effects and you just created a masterpiece of cinematical background music because the young audience will think the song is cool and the older ones will like it because it's nostalgic.",

Retreat and figure out another way. No one is totally invincible with an infinite pain threshold.\n\n*Black Adam* was the worst example of this. Everyone's so overpowered that none of the hits matter. No one takes any damage. No one is truly hurt. Even the human characters are indestructible. That was one thing the first phase of the MCU got (mostly) right. People get injured and it takes them a while to recover. Stuff goes wrong. And so on. By the end it was a little ridiculous, and Phase 2 has been dreadful in that regard *cough* Eternals *cough*.

Basically \"fun city\" was a time period in the late 60s-early 70s where NYC gave incentives to shoot in the city, and a lot of foreign directors and no name directors along with established directors found success. These movies utilized a lot of issues for the time like race relations, urban decay, etc... but they also treated the city as it's own character, and watching them really gives you the feeling that the city is moving and breathing. I particularly love the way that era visually looks and I honestly wish to see that type of film or whatever come back.",

It was amazing.\n\nAntways, I just wanted to say how much of a pleasure it was working on a project for you two. I still have the signed Chong framed image from the game and tickets to your show from Victoria hanging on my wall.\n\nOne of my career highlights, for sure. Looking forward to the movie!\n\nCheers",
