    "description": "I'm certainly late in this discussion but, as I only found out today, others may not know yet: there is an open source alternative to discord in development and it's called **Revolt** (god I love the irony of its name).\n\nIt is not the first time that Discord has appeared in the news seeking to open itself to financial capital or simply be acquired by a third party. When this happens (and I don't believe it's a case of \"if\") the enshittification process will speed up even more.\n\nKnowing that there is an open source alternative gives me hope that our communication will remain relatively private and ad-free.\n\nAnyway, all this to say to those doomers like me that there is hope!",

Even voice chat currently isn't working and looking at the history of the project, isn't going to let people believe the team is even up for the task.",

If i do group content with them sure ill join it. \n\nSecond if you use for buying and selling, like i do, it is just like skype in the day full of scammers. And they made it so easy to impersonate someone for long. You could by nitro and have same user name as someone. Or before with the numbers you could have a similar usernames and trick people.

I’ve tried other alternatives — they’ve been pretty rough (looking at you, Mumble).\n  \n  \nHonestly, this whole ‘going public’ thing is just sensationalist bait. It’s easy to get caught up in the ‘end of days’ narrative. As for Revolt, I don’t even see the irony in the name — it’s more like a straight-up copycat move.\n  \n  \nBut hey, another daily reminder to hate Discord because the media said so, right? For what it’s worth, I’ve got Nitro and it’s staying with me. Just saying.",
