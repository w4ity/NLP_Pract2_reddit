They don‚Äôt really use social media, they forget answering texts, they have so many other friends and projects that actually getting a hold of them is impossible otherwise. Hanging out with them is the best time you could ever have and you get along better than with anyone else, but whenever you‚Äôre not actually together in the same room you always feel like the least prioritized person in their lives.",

Midnight release of Skyrim was wild. Party completely full with all of us talking about different things we were discovering in the game. These days I still have some of the same people on my friends list but the issue is that no one ever wants to play the same thing. The one buddy that I used to play games with the most has become so damn stubborn on trying new games. If it‚Äôs not a well known AAA game franchise he probably wont touch it. The funny thing is when he finally does play a new game that I tried to convince him to play with me he ends up loving it and says it‚Äôs amazing. But by that time I‚Äôve already played the game to death so he ends up playing it with other people. It‚Äôs so damn frustrating and depressing.",
