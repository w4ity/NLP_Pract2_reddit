I was told by one of the staff members that was handling that situation that she came back the next day. She was trying to pull the same thing, then proceeded to sleep in the same locker room. She was doing this for hours on end. She was asked to leave, again and was told she was loitering.

So she left. But she didn’t leave the property. She was then yelling outside of the main entrance that “she was being harrassed, don’t come here” etc etc. which isn’t what was happening. She was the one that was making other members uncomfortable, being nasty to staff members. So she was told that if she tried to come back inside she’d be trespassing.

Fitness,"I've been trying out a new gym (a different instance of the same chain to which I have a membership), and have been silently ranting in my head about their dual cable machines not having weight indicators on the plates (only incrementing numbers).

I started updating my Hevy routine before realising this would throw out all my previous recorded sessions .... so now sitting at home post-workout and reversing the changes.

Fitness,"I joined a new gym about eight months ago.
Before that, I’d been going to several other gyms over the years — one for a bit over two years, and the rest for a few months or with day passes while I was moving around. So I’ve been lifting consistently for quite a while.

A few weeks ago, a trainer came up to me in the middle of my set and told me that some members had complained about my sweaty smell.
Now, I know no one smells like flowers and rainbows while working out, but I always wear freshly washed clothes, prep before the gym, and use deodorant.
In all my years of training, no one has ever said anything like that to me. I even asked former gym buddies and people I used to run with in the middle of summer, and they all said I smell completely normal.

I don’t want to assume the worst, but I’m starting to feel like this might be a racist thing.
I’m a foreigner living in a small village, and at this gym, I’m one of the very few people who lift seriously. Most of the members are older and go more for general mobility than weight training.
It kind of feels like they see me as “too much” and just want me gone.

Now I’m considering switching gyms, but the next closest one is in another village, and I’d have to drive there every time — which isn’t ideal.

For those of you wondering why I don't go to another gym: I live in a little podunk town and the next closest gym is a ~22 min commute. The fuel cost alone would make it more expensive and require 40 more minutes of my life every day to go since I work from home, so that's a total non-starter.

Afterwards my wife starts talking about how surprised she was and how she had ""preconceptions about what kind of people would have a home gym, with big weights like that.""

She's been doing this for years. First, when her friends hit a certain age and started going to the gym, it was, ""Gosh, I had such assumptions about people who go to the gym, I guess I need to rethink that."" ""Jesse told me she's going to the gym twice a week. She's so smart, I never thought of her as someone that invested in her appearance."" When she found out some of her friends did gym classes that involved weights, it was, ""I never thought someone like her would do a strength class. She's not, like, a meathead."" Her doctor started talking to her about bone density, same thing, ""Gosh, I'm so surprised a doctor would ask me if I'm lifting weights."" 

For context, we've been married for 7+ years, and I owned a barbell when I met her. Not only that, she actually works out with a trainer with me, and of course the trainer has her lifting weights.

Fitness,"Feel like I've finally hit a wall with working out. I'm down 85 pounds in the last 3-4 years. And have been running for three of those and lifting for 1.5 years.

I've been training for a 5k and trying to keep my lifting progress the same and I'm just dead. So exhausted. Realized a week ago I've been keeping my energy levels up by drinking double the daily recommended amount of caffeine a day and dropped my intake to nothing. Now just kinda walking around tired nonstop. Motivation done for the most part.

On top of it I've been having ridiculously bad adductor DOMS after my squat days to the point where I can barely walk the next two days and yep, that's fucking up my 5k training too.

I love the changes I've seen over the last couple of years. Love lifting and running, but I feel like such a moron for letting myself get to this rundown point. Going to see my Trainer today to try and figure out a lighter training program and I feel like such a failure (which I realize is ridiculous). But after this amount of time of nonstop gains it's just frustrating. Hate how much time I spend thinking about my diet and working out when I still have love handles. Hate that I feel like a loser because I'm thinking about stopping Barbell squats to avoid that pain.

Funny thing is I'm a fucking therapist and realize all of this is just in my head and shit I can change.

But building up those habits in the first place of gym, diet etc takes so much mental energy and discipline. Now that I'm not seeing instant positive feedback in my look/lifts my brain just goes straight to failure.

The only thing I'm missing is the three plate bench.

It was so awesome, I went back the day I was leaving because I just had to go again.

Also whenever someone wants their bodyfat estimated, you should post a pic of your legs and back as well. Just showing the front of your torso makes it harder to guess accurately. 

One of the only accurate methods of bodyfat testing is getting an MRI but that’s very expensive and a doctor isn’t going to give you one just to see your bodyfat percentage.

I’m running GZCLP.

I recently failed my 3x6 OHP so I had to reset the reps to 3x10. I reset to the weight I failed my 3x10 at previously. I was able to get 10 reps on my first 2 sets but only 6 reps on the last set but last time I did 3x10 I got 9 reps on the last set. Does this mean I got weaker and should I lower the weight?

Fitness,"I want a more pronounced ""bubble butt"" as a guy but I have failed the past 6 months while all my other muscles groups have grown a ton. I cannot figure out what I am doing wrong - my ass is still pretty flat despite lifting a high amount. can somehow judge my glute routine and tell me if its my workout or my genetics? 

**Day 1:** 

\- Bulgarian Split Squat - Glute Focused (minimize quad activation). 3 sets of 8. 

\- Deep Hyperextension, pausing at top. 3 sets of 15

\- Side lying hip abuction. 3 sets of how many I can do. 

**Day 2:**

\- Walking Weighted Lunges - longer strides for glute focus: 3 sets of 15

\- Hip abduction machine. 3 sets of 20.

**Day 3:**

\-Hip Thrusts - 4 sets of 12-15. 

\-Deep Hyperextension, pausing at top. 3 sets of 15

  
that's 10 pretty intense glute sets a week and 12 isolation sets.

Fitness,"Hey guys,

I'm currently following a routine given by a coach I hired at a commercial gym. At first, I was making decent progress, but now I feel like I've stalled on some exercises altogether—I can’t seem to add more weight or reps no matter what approach I try.


I'm a 33-year-old male, 169 cm tall, and currently weigh 70 kg. When I started about a year ago, I was 62 kg. My short-term goal was to reach my current weight, and my long-term goal is to steadily gain strength by adding reps or weight at the beginning of each month.


Here’s my 4-day routine:

Day 1 – Chest and Triceps

4 x 12–15 close grip push-ups

4 x 6–8 barbell bench press (I've been stuck at 50 kg for a couple of months)

4 x 8–10 dumbbell incline bench press (20 kg)

4 x 8–10 incline dumbbell fly (14 kg)

4 x 10–12 dumbbell pullover (22 kg)

4 x 8–10 French press on bench (stuck at 12 kg)

4 x 6–8 seated French press (stuck at 22–26 kg)

4 x 8–10 triceps pulldown (23 kg)


Day 2 – Back and Biceps

4 x 6–7 close grip pull-ups (stuck at 7 max)

4 x 8–10 lat pulldown (52 kg)

4 x 8–10 seated row machine (stuck at 50 kg)

4 x 8–10 T-bar row (25–30 kg)

4 x 6–8 barbell bicep curls (can’t get past 15 kg)

4 x 6–8 cable bicep curls (18 kg)

4 x 8–10 concentration curls (10 kg) [I've been trying Scott curls instead]


Day 3 – Legs and Abs

4 x 6–8 Smith machine squats (60 kg)

4 x 8–10 fixed lunges with dumbbells (7 kg)

4 x 6–8 leg press (120 kg)

4 x 6–10 leg extension (54 kg)

4 x 6–8 seated leg curl (41 kg)

3 x 15 hanging leg raises and hanging oblique leg raises


Day 4 – Upper Body and Shoulders

4 x 8–10 dumbbell front raises (10 kg)

4 x 8–10 dumbbell lateral raises (10 kg)

4 x 8–10 rear delt pec fly (36 kg)

4 x 8–10 seated dumbbell press (18 kg)

4 x 12–15 barbell wrist curls (supination and pronation, 5 kg)

4 x 8–10 dumbbell alternate chest press with twist (20 kg)

4 x 8–10 single-arm seated row machine (25 kg)


How I go about my routine is pushing to 1–2 reps shy of failure and always putting in effort—I try to go out of breath with each exercise or at least get my heart pumping. I've tried techniques like 2–3 reps with 20 seconds of rest on exercises I’m hard-stuck with, but haven’t seen meaningful progress. I’ve also tried lowering reps and adding more weight, but most exercises just end up looking like baby reps or having terrible form.


I've worked with a couple of nutritionists, and the last one recommended the following daily macros:

2350 cal

140–160 g protein

50–60 g fat

280–300 g carbs


My main concern is whether the routine is good and worth sticking to, or if I should make changes. While progress has been slow, there has been some, so I'm not sure if the routine itself is the issue. About five years ago, I used to go to the gym 3–5 days a week, but I stopped a year into the pandemic.

Fitness,"I’m wondering about changing up my exercise routine. Well first of all I don’t do anything super regularly but I have orangetheory 8x/ mo. I realize since I go so randomly it’s probably not that helpful. I have another gym as well that I can go anytime and they have fun cardio and yoga classes. Downside is I now don’t live close enough to walk and it’s sometimes a pain to drive and find parking. 

I’m guessing if I even just went on two 20 min walks most days that might be better since it’d be every day mostly. I would like to do yoga regularly too but it’s harder to do at home and I like it in the gym better. I also am considering starting ballet classes but I’d have to quit orangetheory since they’re close in cost. 

Anyway the goal is to just try to be more toned and maybe lose like 10 pounds. I look fine but I know I gained a bit since being in a relationship and sitting at work. I feel like I eat ok as I eat only until full but now he’s often buying me coffee which I didn’t have before and I’m sure has a good amt of sugar. And other things like that lol. So I’m trying to pay attention more and also I wonder if the times I actually do go to Orangetheory I suddenly eat more. So if I did something less intense but more regular it would be more effective?",2025-04-25T17:06:52,"['i’m', 'wondering', 'changing', 'exercise', 'routine', 'well', 'first', 'don’t', 'anything', 'super', 'regularly', 'orangetheory', '8x', 'mo', 'realize', 'since', 'go', 'randomly', 'it’s', 'probably', 'helpful', 'another', 'gym', 'well', 'go', 'anytime', 'fun', 'cardio', 'yoga', 'class', 'downside', 'don’t', 'live', 'close', 'enough', 'walk', 'it’s', 'sometimes', 'pain', 'drive', 'find', 'parking', 'i’m', 'guessing', 'even', 'went', 'two', '20', 'min', 'walk', 'day', 'might', 'better', 'since', 'it’d', 'every', 'day', 'mostly', 'would', 'like', 'yoga', 'regularly', 'it’s', 'harder', 'home', 'like', 'gym', 'better', 'also', 'considering', 'starting', 'ballet', 'class', 'i’d', 'quit', 'orangetheory', 'since', 'they’re', 'close', 'cost', 'anyway', 'goal', 'try', 'toned', 'maybe', 'lose', 'like', '10', 'pound', 'look', 'fine', 'know', 'gained', 'bit', 'since', 'relationship', 'sitting', 'work', 'feel', 'like', 'eat', 'ok', 'eat', 'full', 'he’s', 'often', 'buying', 'coffee', 'didn’t', 'i’m', 'sure', 'good', 'amt', 'sugar', 'thing', 'like', 'lol', 'i’m', 'trying', 'pay', 'attention', 'also', 'wonder', 'time', 'actually', 'go', 'orangetheory', 'suddenly', 'eat', 'something', 'less', 'intense', 'regular', 'would', 'effective']"

Fitness,"Hello! I (28F, 5'6, 132lbs) started lifting July 2023 with basically 0 muscle and saw some progress after a few months. March 2024 I took a break due to travelling for work but got back to it Nov/Dec 2024. Now I'm at a point where I think my body looks different but I took some progress pics and in almost 2 months there is 0 progress.

I am also thinking my progress overall is not that good to be at this stage yet. I can barely see my ""newbie gains"" and I'm afraid I can't cut yet because I will lose everything.
Here are my progress pics:

Fitness,"Great question — and one that most serious fitness folks wrestle with. Here’s the real impact of drinking after a workout and how much damage it can do:

⸻

The Truth: One Night Out Won’t Erase Your Workout… But It Can Blunt Your Progress

Let’s break down what actually happens if you party after training:

⸻

1. Muscle Recovery and Growth Gets Impaired
	•	Alcohol lowers muscle protein synthesis by up to 37% even if you had protein after your workout.
	•	That means less repair and growth from today’s session.
	•	Your body prioritizes metabolizing alcohol, not rebuilding muscle.

Bottom Line:

If you crushed a workout and then drank heavily, your muscles won’t recover optimally, so the gains are reduced, not erased.

⸻

2. Hormonal Impact
	•	Alcohol decreases testosterone (which helps with muscle building)
	•	Increases cortisol, a catabolic hormone that breaks down muscle
	•	If you’re female, this still matters — these hormones affect your metabolism and recovery

⸻

3. Sleep = Destroyed
	•	Alcohol lowers sleep quality, even if it helps you fall asleep.
	•	You miss out on deep sleep (REM & slow-wave), where most recovery and fat burning happen.

⸻

4. Calorie Bomb
	•	Alcohol + late-night food can easily throw your calorie deficit out the window
	•	3 drinks = 400–600+ calories (not counting mixers or food)

⸻

5. Hydration and Performance
	•	Alcohol dehydrates you, increasing DOMS (muscle soreness)
	•	You’re likely to have a worse session tomorrow, delaying consistency

Tips If You Do Party:
	•	Eat protein before drinking
	•	Drink water between drinks (1:1 rule)
	•	Take electrolytes before bed
	•	Get back on track next day with hydration, walking, and protein-rich meals

⸻

Final Word:

One night won’t kill your progress, but repeated nights like that will stall fat loss and gains. Think of it like 2 steps forward, 1 step back. If you’re serious about visible abs in 5 months — limit the parties or plan them around rest days.",2025-04-29T13:57:25,"['great', 'question', '—', 'one', 'serious', 'fitness', 'folk', 'wrestle', 'here’s', 'real', 'impact', 'drinking', 'workout', 'much', 'damage', 'truth', 'one', 'night', 'won’t', 'erase', 'workout…', 'blunt', 'progress', 'let’s', 'break', 'actually', 'happens', 'party', 'training', '1', 'muscle', 'recovery', 'growth', 'get', 'impaired', '•', 'alcohol', 'lower', 'muscle', 'protein', 'synthesis', '37', 'even', 'protein', 'workout', '•', 'mean', 'less', 'repair', 'growth', 'today’s', 'session', '•', 'body', 'prioritizes', 'metabolizing', 'alcohol', 'rebuilding', 'muscle', 'bottom', 'line', 'crushed', 'workout', 'drank', 'heavily', 'muscle', 'won’t', 'recover', 'optimally', 'gain', 'reduced', 'erased', '2', 'hormonal', 'impact', '•', 'alcohol', 'decrease', 'testosterone', 'help', 'muscle', 'building', '•', 'increase', 'cortisol', 'catabolic', 'hormone', 'break', 'muscle', '•', 'you’re', 'female', 'still', 'matter', '—', 'hormone', 'affect', 'metabolism', 'recovery', '3', 'sleep', 'destroyed', '•', 'alcohol', 'lower', 'sleep', 'quality', 'even', 'help', 'fall', 'asleep', '•', 'miss', 'deep', 'sleep', 'rem', 'slowwave', 'recovery', 'fat', 'burning', 'happen', '4', 'calorie', 'bomb', '•', 'alcohol', 'latenight', 'food', 'easily', 'throw', 'calorie', 'deficit', 'window', '•', '3', 'drink', '400–600', 'calorie', 'counting', 'mixer', 'food', '5', 'hydration', 'performance', '•', 'alcohol', 'dehydrates', 'increasing', 'doms', 'muscle', 'soreness', '•', 'you’re', 'likely', 'worse', 'session', 'tomorrow', 'delaying', 'consistency', 'tip', 'party', '•', 'eat', 'protein', 'drinking', '•', 'drink', 'water', 'drink', '11', 'rule', '•', 'take', 'electrolyte', 'bed', '•', 'get', 'back', 'track', 'next', 'day', 'hydration', 'walking', 'proteinrich', 'meal', 'final', 'word', 'one', 'night', 'won’t', 'kill', 'progress', 'repeated', 'night', 'like', 'stall', 'fat', 'loss', 'gain', 'think', 'like', '2', 'step', 'forward', '1', 'step', 'back', 'you’re', 'serious', 'visible', 'ab', '5', 'month', '—', 'limit', 'party', 'plan', 'around', 'rest', 'day']"

Fitness,"I use a proper training program myself, but I made one and would like to get some feedback. It is meant to be a  power and hypertrophy program with low volume and meant specifically for saving time. It could also be a program meant for simply staying fit. If everything is OK, I am thinking of doing this sometime in the future if I need something that takes less time.

Day 1. Main lift: bench press. Secondary: front raises. Optional : chest flys, tricep extensions.

Day 2. Main lift: squat. Secondary : calve raises, leg extensions.

Day 3. Main lift: Overhead press. Secondary: side raises, front raises. 

Day 4. Main lift: deadlift. Secondary: bridges. Optional: romainian deadlifts, leg curls.

Day 5. Main lift: pull-ups. Secondary: rear delt flys, hammer curls. Optional: bicep dumbbell curls, shrugs, bent over barbell rows.

For main exercises.
3 warm-up sets. 25%, 50%, 75% of weight that will be used in working sets. Reps: 7,6,8.
3 working sets. Reps: 6-14

For secondary exercises.
1 warm-up set. 50% weight of working sets.
Reps: 10
3 working sets. Reps 8-20. 

For optional exercises. 
Same rules as secondary. Where there are 2 optional exercises, you may alternate between them weekly.

For day 5 in the start, it will need to be a bit different if you can not do pull-ups. Do this while training for pull-ups.
Day 5.
3 sets deadhang to failure.
Bent over barbell rows as main exercise.
Rear dealt flys and bicep dumbbell curls as secondary exercises. 3 sets each. 
Since 1 day a week is very low frequency, to get to pull-ups quicker, try adding something on day 7 and 2 or days 1 and 3.

Day 7 or 1. Barbell rows 3 sets. Curls 3 sets.
Day 2 or 3. Barbell rows 3 sets. Curls 2 sets.
From week 4 while dead hanging start trying to do pull-ups. Even if it's only quarter reps or a slight pulling motion. Once you are able to do a pull-up, start doing it on the other 2 days also. Once you get to doing 10 pull-ups on 2 sets, leave the dead hangs. When all 3 sets are at 10 reps, take out 2 sets of barbell rows. On the one set of barbell rows, use heavier weight. Use a reps range of 6-10. Once all 3 sets are at 14 reps, add weight and drop reps to 6. You may now take out the barbell rows and the additional 2 training days.

I was planning on making every 8th week a deload week.  For main exercises, do 3 sets with 25% weight and 1 set with 50%. For secondary exercises, do 2 sets with 30% weight and 1 set with 60%.

Fitness,"Are there any rough ballpark estimates as to the expected muscle to fat gain ratio at different levels of energy surplus? I am not looking for anything too accurate as I know it is dependent on individual factors such as training age, quality of stimulus and a host of genetic factors, but simply a heuristic to make an expected guess as to how long a given amount of fat cut would take to re-accumulate over a bulk.

Some estimated ranges like 70-80% muscle 20-30% fat for +5-10% surplus, 40-60 for +15-20 etc (purely examples). If even such broad ballparks are not useful due to variation resulting from individual circumstances, then I guess knowing that would help, too. 

If it helps to give me a more personal estimate, I'm nearing 2 years in training age (or 1½ only accounting for time not in a deficit), and I'm planning on resuming a 'lean' bulk of around +5-7% caloric surplus (roughly 0.5 to 0.7kg or 0.6 to 0.8% bw/month).

Fitness,"I’ve started tracking macros and working out very recently (a month of playing around and about a month of being serious with a plan) and to save time I’ve started doing my 9 sets back to back. It’s not a super set? But essentially I’ll go through 10 reps of split squats followed immediately by 10 reps of Romanian deadlifts, one arm rows, dumbbell bench press, dumbbell overhead press, overhead dumbbell extension, dumbbell curl, 30 seconds of plank and 10 crunches. I’ll do this 3-5 times as my workout 2-3 times a week. 

My goal is to maintain muscle mass while in a deficit because I’ve lost 75 lbs and I don’t want to lose any muscle now that I’m closing in on my goal weight. My secondary goal is to do a pull up before my birthday! I gave myself 5 months to reach this goal but I’m absolutely amazed by how much closer I am getting every day. 

Is there a problem with doing the workout this way? I definitely get my heart racing and feel the burn by the end of the workout. Nothing crazy though, I’m not looking to grow my muscles per se. I am not pushing to failure, I am doing controlled movements and getting slower and more steady every day. I have to admit I have seen insane improvement since I’ve started doing this so I think I’m unintentionally growing my muscles. My body fat percentage and weight are going down steadily since starting the resistance training. I regularly incorporate cardio and started running up stairs on my walks too.

Fitness,"Male, 40s

After a life of being very active but not really working out, I'm starting out doing upper body push/pull resistance training about three times a week. Usually three sets to failure or near-failure of four pulling exercises (wide grip pullups, neutral grip pullups, dumbell raises, lateral raises) and three pushing exercises (diamond pushups, dips, seated overhead dumbell presses). I have two main questions:

1. What's a good pushing exercise to add, preferably bodyweight?

I've been taking protein supplements and 4.5g creatine/day. I'm eating ~ 1.4g protein per day per kg weight, give or take, mostly from protein shakes and grilled chicken breast. Currently eating ~1900 - 2300 kcal/day (net total, workout estimations included).
