I was the lead designer on your game Cheech and Chong, Bud Farm. I was the one that mentioned that I met Gaye Delorme in a pub below the skytrain station in New Westminster. He mentioned that he knew you two while attempting to pay for his house wine with his fake eyeball after he signed my sketchbook (unprompted, lol) ""Gaye Fuckball Delorme"" he also got into a heated arguement with a Nigerian guy named Newman. It was amazing.

Antways, I just wanted to say how much of a pleasure it was working on a project for you two. I still have the signed Chong framed image from the game and tickets to your show from Victoria hanging on my wall.

One of my career highlights, for sure. Looking forward to the movie!
