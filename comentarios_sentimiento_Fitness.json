She was the one that was making other members uncomfortable, being nasty to staff members.

Today I realised that the weights are printed on the rear of the plates (facepalm). I started updating my Hevy routine before realising this would throw out all my previous recorded sessions .... so now sitting at home post-workout and reversing the changes.\n\nGood times.\n\n(Aware that weights don't actually matter on these machines, but I'm a numbers-driven nerd and have always used weights before when possible).",

I even asked former gym buddies and people I used to run with in the middle of summer, and they all said I smell completely normal.\n\nI don‚Äôt want to assume the worst, but I‚Äôm starting to feel like this might be a racist thing.\nI‚Äôm a foreigner living in a small village, and at this gym, I‚Äôm one of the very few people who lift seriously. Most of the members are older and go more for general mobility than weight training.\nIt kind of feels like they see me as ‚Äútoo much‚Äù and just want me gone.\n\nNow I‚Äôm considering switching gyms, but the next closest one is in another village, and I‚Äôd have to drive there every time ‚Äî which isn‚Äôt ideal.\n\nHas anyone else experienced something like this?",

It's nice to see change over the last 6 weeks (I only get out once a week).¬†\n\n\nAlso surprised the weight is so low, I have big thigs so figured my quads would be stronger.¬†",

My gym does not have a daycare. These children are legally unable to hold memberships. Why are they here *touching fucking everything*? Why is there, what appears to be an 8 year old in the men's change room?\n\nWhy the fuck am I being exposed to this? \n\nI actually hate my gym more than I did before, which is a pretty difficult task since I absolutely *loathe* my gym with every fibre of my being. Between the dog-shit machine selection, single set of bumper plates for the entire gym to share, absurd membership fee, and functionally subsidizing a pool I will never use because public pools are fucking gross, I'm literally trying to figure out if I can afford a new house with a garage so I can put a gym in it.\n\nFor those of you wondering why I don't go to another gym: I live in a little podunk town and the next closest gym is a ~22 min commute. The fuel cost alone would make it more expensive and require 40 more minutes of my life every day to go since I work from home, so that's a total non-starter.\n\nAnyway, this is a long borderline rant to say some kid literally touched me with a sucker and that is not fucking okay.",

She's so smart, I never thought of her as someone that invested in her appearance.\" When she found out some of her friends did gym classes that involved weights, it was, \"I never thought someone like her would do a strength class. She's not, like, a meathead.\" Her doctor started talking to her about bone density, same thing, \"Gosh, I'm so surprised a doctor would ask me if I'm lifting weights.\" \n\nFor context, we've been married for 7+ years, and I owned a barbell when I met her. Not only that, she actually works out with a trainer with me, and of course the trainer has her lifting weights. SHE LIFTS WEIGHTS and has been doing so for over a year now. Despite that, she can't give up making condescending passive-aggressive comments about it.",

Realized a week ago I've been keeping my energy levels up by drinking double the daily recommended amount of caffeine a day and dropped my intake to nothing. Now just kinda walking around tired nonstop. Motivation done for the most part.\n\nOn top of it I've been having ridiculously bad adductor DOMS after my squat days to the point where I can barely walk the next two days and yep, that's fucking up my 5k training too.\n\nI love the changes I've seen over the last couple of years. Love lifting and running, but I feel like such a moron for letting myself get to this rundown point. Going to see my Trainer today to try and figure out a lighter training program and I feel like such a failure (which I realize is ridiculous). But after this amount of time of nonstop gains it's just frustrating. Hate how much time I spend thinking about my diet and working out when I still have love handles. Hate that I feel like a loser because I'm thinking about stopping Barbell squats to avoid that pain.\n\nFunny thing is I'm a fucking therapist and realize all of this is just in my head and shit I can change.\n\nBut building up those habits in the first place of gym, diet etc takes so much mental energy and discipline. Now that I'm not seeing instant positive feedback in my look/lifts my brain just goes straight to failure. \n\nWeird long rant/vent. Goddamn",

It's so hard to care about a squat bench deadlift PR though after I've experienced the euphoria of a snatch PR so it's impossible to stop chasing the light at the end of the tunnel.\n\nAt least with bodybuilding training I had abs and women said I looked \"good\", now there's only a third of the time left each day for bodybuilding (but I have to use it for training my abs and lower back), I have a dad bod, skinnier arms, thicker legs and back with a massive ass, and somehow all that time I sacrificed each day from normal bodybuilding training is just not translating into any snatch PR's even though I am putting more effort in than ever.\n\nJust fuck olympic weightlifting - I wish it wasn't such a skill based sport.",

Just a terrible relationship with food.\n\nI say all that to say this:  I've hit most of my personal strength milestones.  Five plate squat and deadlift.  I can do a few chinups or pullups.  The only thing I'm missing is the three plate bench.  At the beginning of the year I told myself I'd really focus on cleaning up my diet once I hit that milestone (the whole \"mass moves mass\" thing).  Been stuck at 300lbs ever since.  \n\nTried 315 a week after hitting 300 just to YOLO it and got stapled.  Picked up a semi-unrelated shoulder issue in March.  If I don't at least up my PR by the Garage Gym Competition coming up, I'm afraid I might just have to call it and accept that its not going to happen.\n\nSuppose this is more of a vent than a rant, but I'm just really bummed about this one.",

Last december I started a diet of 1200 calories a day with 1 or 2 cheat days a week but still getting results as I do 10-20000 steps daily and lots of strength training, but I messed up past 2-3 weeks due to a wrist injury. Depressed I dropped my intake to 900 with no cheat days and 25,000 steps daily.  Whilst I'm at 150 lbs now and I've never had a more chiseled face,  I've noticed sagging stomach fat. What should I do to tighten it? I don't want to bulk and gain facial fat again. I've never been this happier and worried at the same time.",

Which may sound flattering but there are a few caveats to this compliment.  First, she is a bodybuilding coach, so she doesn't understand I am nowhere near powerlifting standards for strength.  Second, she is a body building coach who did not mistake me for a body builder.  Not that I train for size, but it would have been nice.  Either way, I shall accept this very small and incorrect compliment.",

Nevermind that it's the most inaccurate method available, (read: most likely way wrong - [see here](http://web.archive.org/web/20130301185720/https://paindatabase.com/body-fat/)) you're still just putting an arbitrary number to the body you have. Despite people's claim that they are shooting for a number, they're really shooting for look - like a six pack.\n\nSo let's stopping mucking around with trivialities and get to the heart of the matter. This thread shall serve two purposes:\n\n1. **Physique critiques.** Post some pics and ask about muscles or body parts you need to work on. Or specifically ask about a lagging body part and what exercises worked for others.\n2. An outlet for people that want to show off their efforts that would otherwise be removed due to [Rule 4](https://old.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_rule_.234), and\n\nLet's keep things civil, don't be a creep, and adhere to [Rule 1](http://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/wiki/rules#wiki_1._hate_speech_and_discriminatory_remarks_are_not_allowed.). This isn't a thread to announce what you find attractive in a mate.

Most people in this sub don‚Äôt know what bodyfat percentages look like, leading to them estimating inaccurately. Also whenever someone wants their bodyfat estimated, you should post a pic of your legs and back as well. Just showing the front of your torso makes it harder to guess accurately. \n\nOne of the only accurate methods of bodyfat testing is getting an MRI but that‚Äôs very expensive and a doctor isn‚Äôt going to give you one just to see your bodyfat percentage. \n\nKnowing your bodyfat can help people track progress.

Much safer if my form is right, which I believe it is.  If I had a squat rack with safety pins, it would be one thing.  I'd still do bodyweight squats to keep my mobility up.

I'm 19, I weigh about 180 pounds (82kg) 177cm tall. I plan on doing cardio on the way there and back which is about 5 miles total then strength exercises in the gym everyday of the week for the next few weeks.\n\nMy question is, would this be over-doing it for a beginner? Or is it a matter of mental fortitude and plodding on no matter what?\n\nEDIT: I should have probably formatted this a bit better but I do plan on looking at some routines and continuing the gym even after a few weeks, just certain circumstances aren't allowing it. I also know that 7 days is overkill and that the body needs rest but I believe it could help build discipline and wont cause any major problems considering its for a few weeks max.",

Lower weights feel easier, but the range of motion I get falls apart at just about the same time nonetheless.\n\nOf course everyone is different, and I'm generally trying to move up in weight once I get to the 12 rep range, but I'm just curious if what I've noticed is indicative of anything in particular",

I used to be very fit but 1.5 years ago I went through a bad surgery that impacted my life and developed autoimmune hyperthyroidism, couldn‚Äôt exercise of 1.5 years. I gained 10 kilos mostly cause of the eating, lack of movement, hormones all over the place.\n\nSurprisingly my muscle mass is still good but not feeling as strong, my cardio is not as good either but I started running a couple of weeks ago and I can do a 5-6 KM jog so I guess working out for 8 years before diligently didn‚Äôt go to waste. Wondering if anyone has any advice on how I can shed this weight in a healthy and timely way. Was thinking I sign up for a marathon and push myself to run 4 times a week, and do one full body workout to maintain my muscles, while also trying to fix my food, with hyperthyroid I was always hungry and eating too much. Now I‚Äôm on meds to things are slowing down and my heart rate is lower again.\n\nAny thoughts on my strategy?",

I work from home a lot, and I figured I could just do 3 intervals every couple of hours whenever I take a break from working. I could easily achieve a dozen intervals a day that way, Or is it better to do all of those intervals in one go?",

My short-term goal was to reach my current weight, and my long-term goal is to steadily gain strength by adding reps or weight at the beginning of each month.\n\n\nHere‚Äôs my 4-day routine:\n\nDay 1 ‚Äì Chest and Triceps\n\n4 x 12‚Äì15 close grip push-ups\n\n4 x 6‚Äì8 barbell bench press (I've been stuck at 50 kg for a couple of months)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 dumbbell incline bench press (20 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 incline dumbbell fly (14 kg)\n\n4 x 10‚Äì12 dumbbell pullover (22 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 French press on bench (stuck at 12 kg)\n\n4 x 6‚Äì8 seated French press (stuck at 22‚Äì26 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 triceps pulldown (23 kg)\n\n\nDay 2 ‚Äì Back and Biceps\n\n4 x 6‚Äì7 close grip pull-ups (stuck at 7 max)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 lat pulldown (52 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 seated row machine (stuck at 50 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 T-bar row (25‚Äì30 kg)\n\n4 x 6‚Äì8 barbell bicep curls (can‚Äôt get past 15 kg)\n\n4 x 6‚Äì8 cable bicep curls (18 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 concentration curls (10 kg) [I've been trying Scott curls instead]\n\n\nDay 3 ‚Äì Legs and Abs\n\n4 x 6‚Äì8 Smith machine squats (60 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 fixed lunges with dumbbells (7 kg)\n\n4 x 6‚Äì8 leg press (120 kg)\n\n4 x 6‚Äì10 leg extension (54 kg)\n\n4 x 6‚Äì8 seated leg curl (41 kg)\n\n3 x 15 hanging leg raises and hanging oblique leg raises\n\n\nDay 4 ‚Äì Upper Body and Shoulders\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 dumbbell front raises (10 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 dumbbell lateral raises (10 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 rear delt pec fly (36 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 seated dumbbell press (18 kg)\n\n4 x 12‚Äì15 barbell wrist curls (supination and pronation, 5 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 dumbbell alternate chest press with twist (20 kg)\n\n4 x 8‚Äì10 single-arm seated row machine (25 kg)\n\n\nHow I go about my routine is pushing to 1‚Äì2 reps shy of failure and always putting in effort‚ÄîI try to go out of breath with each exercise or at least get my heart pumping. I've tried techniques like 2‚Äì3 reps with 20 seconds of rest on exercises I‚Äôm hard-stuck with, but haven‚Äôt seen meaningful progress. I‚Äôve also tried lowering reps and adding more weight, but most exercises just end up looking like baby reps or having terrible form.\n\n\nI've worked with a couple of nutritionists, and the last one recommended the following daily macros:\n\n2350 cal\n\n140‚Äì160 g protein\n\n50‚Äì60 g fat\n\n280‚Äì300 g carbs\n\n\nMy main concern is whether the routine is good and worth sticking to, or if I should make changes. While progress has been slow, there has been some, so I'm not sure if the routine itself is the issue. About five years ago, I used to go to the gym 3‚Äì5 days a week, but I stopped a year into the pandemic. I started back roughly 10 months ago, and this time I‚Äôm trying to take it seriously.",

I realize since I go so randomly it‚Äôs probably not that helpful. I have another gym as well that I can go anytime and they have fun cardio and yoga classes. Downside is I now don‚Äôt live close enough to walk and it‚Äôs sometimes a pain to drive and find parking. \n\nI‚Äôm guessing if I even just went on two 20 min walks most days that might be better since it‚Äôd be every day mostly. I would like to do yoga regularly too but it‚Äôs harder to do at home and I like it in the gym better. I also am considering starting ballet classes but I‚Äôd have to quit orangetheory since they‚Äôre close in cost. \n\nAnyway the goal is to just try to be more toned and maybe lose like 10 pounds. I look fine but I know I gained a bit since being in a relationship and sitting at work. I feel like I eat ok as I eat only until full but now he‚Äôs often buying me coffee which I didn‚Äôt have before and I‚Äôm sure has a good amt of sugar. And other things like that lol. So I‚Äôm trying to pay attention more and also I wonder if the times I actually do go to Orangetheory I suddenly eat more. So if I did something less intense but more regular it would be more effective?",

March 2024 I took a break due to travelling for work but got back to it Nov/Dec 2024. Now I'm at a point where I think my body looks different but I took some progress pics and in almost 2 months there is 0 progress.\n\nI am also thinking my progress overall is not that good to be at this stage yet. I can barely see my \"newbie gains\" and I'm afraid I can't cut yet because I will lose everything.\nHere are my progress pics:\n https://ibb.co/VWhHmqDf\n\nI would really appreciate inputs in case the progress is too slow. I eat enough protein, sleep okayish (6-7 hours, sometimes less but I've always been this way). 3-4x in the gym, lifting to failure etc.\n\nThank you!",

        "comment": "Great question ‚Äî and one that most serious fitness folks wrestle with. Here‚Äôs the real impact of drinking after a workout and how much damage it can do:\n\n‚∏ª\n\nThe Truth: One Night Out Won‚Äôt Erase Your Workout‚Ä¶ But It Can Blunt Your Progress\n\nLet‚Äôs break down what actually happens if you party after training:\n\n‚∏ª\n\n1. Muscle Recovery and Growth Gets Impaired\n\t‚Ä¢\tAlcohol lowers muscle protein synthesis by up to 37% even if you had protein after your workout.\n\t‚Ä¢\tThat means less repair and growth from today‚Äôs session.\n\t‚Ä¢\tYour body prioritizes metabolizing alcohol, not rebuilding muscle.\n\nBottom Line:\n\nIf you crushed a workout and then drank heavily, your muscles won‚Äôt recover optimally, so the gains are reduced, not erased.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n2. Hormonal Impact\n\t‚Ä¢\tAlcohol decreases testosterone (which helps with muscle building)\n\t‚Ä¢\tIncreases cortisol, a catabolic hormone that breaks down muscle\n\t‚Ä¢\tIf you‚Äôre female, this still matters ‚Äî these hormones affect your metabolism and recovery\n\n‚∏ª\n\n3. Sleep = Destroyed\n\t‚Ä¢\tAlcohol lowers sleep quality, even if it helps you fall asleep.\n\t‚Ä¢\tYou miss out on deep sleep (REM & slow-wave), where most recovery and fat burning happen.\n\n‚∏ª\n\n4. Calorie Bomb\n\t‚Ä¢\tAlcohol + late-night food can easily throw your calorie deficit out the window\n\t‚Ä¢\t3 drinks = 400‚Äì600+ calories (not counting mixers or food)\n\n‚∏ª\n\n5. Hydration and Performance\n\t‚Ä¢\tAlcohol dehydrates you, increasing DOMS (muscle soreness)\n\t‚Ä¢\tYou‚Äôre likely to have a worse session tomorrow, delaying consistency\n\nTips If You Do Party:\n\t‚Ä¢\tEat protein before drinking\n\t‚Ä¢\tDrink water between drinks (1:1 rule)\n\t‚Ä¢\tTake electrolytes before bed\n\t‚Ä¢\tGet back on track next day with hydration, walking, and protein-rich meals\n\n‚∏ª\n\nFinal Word:\n\nOne night won‚Äôt kill your progress, but repeated nights like that will stall fat loss and gains. Think of it like 2 steps forward, 1 step back. If you‚Äôre serious about visible abs in 5 months ‚Äî limit the parties or plan them around rest days.",

        "comment": "I use a proper training program myself, but I made one and would like to get some feedback. It is meant to be a  power and hypertrophy program with low volume and meant specifically for saving time. It could also be a program meant for simply staying fit. If everything is OK, I am thinking of doing this sometime in the future if I need something that takes less time.\n\nDay 1. Main lift: bench press. Secondary: front raises. Optional : chest flys, tricep extensions.\n\nDay 2. Main lift: squat. Secondary : calve raises, leg extensions.\n\nDay 3. Main lift: Overhead press. Secondary: side raises, front raises. \n\nDay 4. Main lift: deadlift. Secondary: bridges. Optional: romainian deadlifts, leg curls.\n\nDay 5. Main lift: pull-ups. Secondary: rear delt flys, hammer curls. Optional: bicep dumbbell curls, shrugs, bent over barbell rows.\n\nFor main exercises.\n3 warm-up sets. 25%, 50%, 75% of weight that will be used in working sets. Reps: 7,6,8.\n3 working sets. Reps: 6-14\n\nFor secondary exercises.\n1 warm-up set. 50% weight of working sets.\nReps: 10\n3 working sets. Reps 8-20. \n\nFor optional exercises. \nSame rules as secondary. Where there are 2 optional exercises, you may alternate between them weekly.\n\nFor day 5 in the start, it will need to be a bit different if you can not do pull-ups. Do this while training for pull-ups.\nDay 5.\n3 sets deadhang to failure.\nBent over barbell rows as main exercise.\nRear dealt flys and bicep dumbbell curls as secondary exercises. 3 sets each. \nSince 1 day a week is very low frequency, to get to pull-ups quicker, try adding something on day 7 and 2 or days 1 and 3.\n\nDay 7 or 1. Barbell rows 3 sets. Curls 3 sets.\nDay 2 or 3. Barbell rows 3 sets. Curls 2 sets.\nFrom week 4 while dead hanging start trying to do pull-ups. Even if it's only quarter reps or a slight pulling motion. Once you are able to do a pull-up, start doing it on the other 2 days also. Once you get to doing 10 pull-ups on 2 sets, leave the dead hangs. When all 3 sets are at 10 reps, take out 2 sets of barbell rows. On the one set of barbell rows, use heavier weight. Use a reps range of 6-10. Once all 3 sets are at 14 reps, add weight and drop reps to 6. You may now take out the barbell rows and the additional 2 training days.\n\nI was planning on making every 8th week a deload week.  For main exercises, do 3 sets with 25% weight and 1 set with 50%. For secondary exercises, do 2 sets with 30% weight and 1 set with 60%. Is everything OK.",

I know diet is not the reason, I don't think that stress or lack of sleep is really an issue. I am reluctant to blame overtraining, because my volume isn't really that high, and I am on a bulk so my body should have plenty of energy to recover as well as ever.\n\n  \nIs there anything I'm missing that could be the cause, or should I really be considering a deload and hope that I just need more recovery time?",

So we just do push-ups every day and try to steadily increase our repetitions.\nI told someone else about this challenge and they said it is unhealthy to do more than 25 push-ups in a row because it is bad for the joints. Is there any merit to that? Or can I safely go up to 100 reps in a set? I tried searching Reddit but most threads were about how many reps people can do, and not about the safety of doing many reps¬†in row.",

I've been doing a PPL split with 1 rest day a week, but would it be beneficial to pick up a different program multiple rest days and only boulder on my rest days? Or would it be ok to strength train in the morning and boulder/climb in the evening as long as I'm not doing both my pull days?",

This happened to me a while I went for a walk it was far and I felt like anger motivation, and I regret it it was hot I was in a hoodie and sweat pants but I was like I'ma walk here half way daily and on weekends the full length but then the next day come and I don't go for the walk next thing you know 3 weeks have passed and I didn't walk any day mind you I'm obese but pretty young but I can't seem to stick to it but rn I'm trying again from the start but what should I do to prevent this.",

        "comment": "Are there any rough ballpark estimates as to the expected muscle to fat gain ratio at different levels of energy surplus? I am not looking for anything too accurate as I know it is dependent on individual factors such as training age, quality of stimulus and a host of genetic factors, but simply a heuristic to make an expected guess as to how long a given amount of fat cut would take to re-accumulate over a bulk.\n\nSome estimated ranges like 70-80% muscle 20-30% fat for +5-10% surplus, 40-60 for +15-20 etc (purely examples). If even such broad ballparks are not useful due to variation resulting from individual circumstances, then I guess knowing that would help, too. \n\nIf it helps to give me a more personal estimate, I'm nearing 2 years in training age (or 1¬Ω only accounting for time not in a deficit), and I'm planning on resuming a 'lean' bulk of around +5-7% caloric surplus (roughly 0.5 to 0.7kg or 0.6 to 0.8% bw/month). What I'm interested in estimating is how many months of such a bulk would it take until I regain, say, 0.5 kg of fat -- perhaps 2 to 4 months in the optimistic case?",

I'm mainly focusing on cardio and stamina so I run around 20 minutes per day, with 2 10 minute intervals and a 5 minute walking break in between. But the next day after work out (I work out at dinner/nighttime) my legs are extremely sore, to the point where it kind of hurts to walk or even jog. I know pain is something a lot of people experience, especially those that have not been working out regularly. But mine lasted for a few days until it got better, so I was wondering if this is something common. Is it something dangerous / am I doing something wrong, and what should I do to prevent this from happening? (I do stretch before the session but not after, and I don't wear any running shoes, so I'm considering buying one.)\n\nMy goal is to get a strong leg and a strong heart (good cardio/stamina) from workouts. Please share any tips as well if you have some. Thank you so much for reading the long comment!",

        "comment": "I‚Äôve started tracking macros and working out very recently (a month of playing around and about a month of being serious with a plan) and to save time I‚Äôve started doing my 9 sets back to back. It‚Äôs not a super set? But essentially I‚Äôll go through 10 reps of split squats followed immediately by 10 reps of Romanian deadlifts, one arm rows, dumbbell bench press, dumbbell overhead press, overhead dumbbell extension, dumbbell curl, 30 seconds of plank and 10 crunches. I‚Äôll do this 3-5 times as my workout 2-3 times a week. \n\nMy goal is to maintain muscle mass while in a deficit because I‚Äôve lost 75 lbs and I don‚Äôt want to lose any muscle now that I‚Äôm closing in on my goal weight. My secondary goal is to do a pull up before my birthday! I gave myself 5 months to reach this goal but I‚Äôm absolutely amazed by how much closer I am getting every day. \n\nIs there a problem with doing the workout this way? I definitely get my heart racing and feel the burn by the end of the workout. Nothing crazy though, I‚Äôm not looking to grow my muscles per se. I am not pushing to failure, I am doing controlled movements and getting slower and more steady every day. I have to admit I have seen insane improvement since I‚Äôve started doing this so I think I‚Äôm unintentionally growing my muscles. My body fat percentage and weight are going down steadily since starting the resistance training. I regularly incorporate cardio and started running up stairs on my walks too. \n\nI‚Äôm also curious about the difference between being a mesomorph and newbie gains? Is there any way to tell? I‚Äôve always been husky and muscular but I attributed it to my weight.",

Usually three sets to failure or near-failure of four pulling exercises (wide grip pullups, neutral grip pullups, dumbell raises, lateral raises) and three pushing exercises (diamond pushups, dips, seated overhead dumbell presses). I have two main questions:\n\n1. What's a good pushing exercise to add, preferably bodyweight?\n\n2. I'm going to start doing core work and cardio either on off days or 4-6 hours before or after my main session. If these workouts involve some decently taxing strength movements themselves (i.e., pushups for burpees, dead hangs for leg raises), will that mess up my progress in my main workouts? Will minor overtraining like that tend to wreck my muscles or just not add more progress?",

I hate the bar on my back and it‚Äôs a huge limiter in actually moving serious weight, so I‚Äôve made SSB squats my main lift and dropped back squats. I‚Äôm looking for a secondary lift to switch things up. I‚Äôve heard hex-bar deadlifts are actually more of a squat motion. Would that fit well in my existing lower body suite of lifts? I‚Äôd prefer to avoid front squats, as again, I just find the bar awkward to hold.\n\nI‚Äôve been lifting for about 15 months and squatted twice a week the whole time, though my exact routine changed multiple times.",

How can I structure the training to increase the maxes? Do you recommend continuing with 531? I recover quite well and I like to train every day",

After ruling out health issues with my doctor I think it came down to simply not eating enough. So ive put myself on a high calorie diet. I‚Äôve been focusing on getting the calories in and less about the type of calories I put in too because I‚Äôm finding high calorie healthy slightly difficult. But anyway I put working out on hold because I was afraid to lose weight, so I need some pointers. Sorry long post.",

I'm eating ~ 1.4g protein per day per kg weight, give or take, mostly from protein shakes and grilled chicken breast.

I suppose that I can do 1 pushup daily without rest days, and that at some point I could increase the the rep to 2 and so on, also without needing to insert a rest day in between, as how we don't rest because the previous day we walked ...   \n  \nFor this experiment i think of picking pushups +1 , squats +1, plank +10sec, pull-up +1 and maybe a run +100 m.   \n  \n1. I think this exercises are balanced but what would you put in such a routine?   \n2. I was thinking of increasing the amount every 7 days.",

My routine is mainly cardio - about 30 minutes on the treadmill (incline walk), 20 minutes on the bike, and some other cardio exercises. After I finish, I have a protein shake and then a big meal when I get home.\n\nFYI, I feel fine working out like this - I don't get too tired, I'm mainly just concerned if this has any negative effect on my body",

It's a four-day upper/lower split of the same lifts for the whole 12 weeks, but weeks 1-4 you do weights you can only lift for 8-12 reps, weeks 5-8 is 6-8 reps, and the end is 4-6 reps. \n\nI'm finding it intimidating to move into the phase of heavier weights, I worry about injuring myself and just generally feel not ready to move out of the 8-12 rep range. Especially because you only hit most of the lifts once a week, I haven't really had much practice at some of them. I'm in my 40s, have back issues, and do not feel invincible. \n\nShould I be brave and just start lifting heavier? Or draw it out longer before moving to the heavier weights? My goal is recomp and that part is working really well so far (building muscle and losing inches, but staying the same weight. I eat at maintenance with a fuckton of protein).",
