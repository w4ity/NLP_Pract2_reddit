Category one: overworked, tired, semi-depressed parents who haven’t done anything fun since they met their spouse in 2012 and prioritized turning into everything you always said you’d never become in your early 20s. Their wife of several years becomes violently angry at the mere thought of video games existing and it’s always someone’s birthday the next day so they can’t stay up ""late."" 
You meet once a year and they always leave early and it deflates the fun of meeting at all.

Category two: Jobless, unambitious stoners on welfare who never progressed past 17 mentally, still think Bam Margera is the absolute pinnacle of entertainers, and the only game they play online is some obscure japanese card game, or they just have 12 000+ hours in one single game that you just don’t see the appeal in playing anymore at all.  

Category three: Someone who is actually fun, interesting and compatible in personality and taste. They don’t really use social media, they forget answering texts, they have so many other friends and projects that actually getting a hold of them is impossible otherwise. Hanging out with them is the best time you could ever have and you get along better than with anyone else, but whenever you’re not actually together in the same room you always feel like the least prioritized person in their lives.",2025-04-29T08:31:59,"['apparent', 'choice', 'friend', 'adult', 'category', 'one', 'overworked', 'tired', 'semidepressed', 'parent', 'haven’t', 'done', 'anything', 'fun', 'since', 'met', 'spouse', '2012', 'prioritized', 'turning', 'everything', 'always', 'said', 'you’d', 'never', 'become', 'early', '20', 'wife', 'several', 'year', 'becomes', 'violently', 'angry', 'mere', 'thought', 'video', 'game', 'existing', 'it’s', 'always', 'someone’s', 'birthday', 'next', 'day', 'can’t', 'stay', 'late', 'meet', 'year', 'always', 'leave', 'early', 'deflates', 'fun', 'meeting', 'category', 'two', 'jobless', 'unambitious', 'stoner', 'welfare', 'never', 'progressed', 'past', '17', 'mentally', 'still', 'think', 'bam', 'margera', 'absolute', 'pinnacle', 'entertainer', 'game', 'play', 'online', 'obscure', 'japanese', 'card', 'game', '12', '000', 'hour', 'one', 'single', 'game', 'don’t', 'see', 'appeal', 'playing', 'anymore', 'category', 'three', 'someone', 'actually', 'fun', 'interesting', 'compatible', 'personality', 'taste', 'don’t', 'really', 'use', 'social', 'medium', 'forget', 'answering', 'text', 'many', 'friend', 'project', 'actually', 'getting', 'hold', 'impossible', 'otherwise', 'hanging', 'best', 'time', 'could', 'ever', 'get', 'along', 'better', 'anyone', 'else', 'whenever', 'you’re', 'actually', 'together', 'room', 'always', 'feel', 'like', 'least', 'prioritized', 'person', 'life']"

gaming,"It's akin to Diablo 2 Resurrected in my mind, it's still the same underlying game with a few QoL improvements.

Personally... would be lying if I said I didn't want ""more"" from it, but I think they did an overall excellent job; it's extremely faithful to the original game; some key glitches patched (for better or for worse) and the leveling improvements are very nice.

I would have liked to see some more work put into housing, luck re-worked a bit, and addressing uniques to be like level-scaled vs leveled on pickup / acquisition (or some item added to re-level the item) so players don't feel forced to wait to acquire said items until they are at X level.

I think also because they touched the birthsigns and tweaked attributes that some stones should have also been added for console players so that players can adjust their birthsign perhaps at the cost of X sigil stones or something; re-creating a character can be a pretty feelsbad moment and console players have no real solution to fix this otherwise.

Quite a few visual bugs as well, performance issues during dusk and dawn as the lighting system I presume gets a lot of updates as well.
